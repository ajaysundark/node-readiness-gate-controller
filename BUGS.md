## Known Bugs in Node Readiness Gate Controller

 Summary

  The enhanced logging successfully revealed the exact problem:

  Root Cause: Node status updates (condition changes) are NOT triggering node reconciliations. The
  sequence is:

  1. Node created with TestReady: False condition → triggers multiple reconciliations with ruleCount: 0
   (rule not in cache yet)
  2. Rule created → triggers rule reconciliation → adds rule to cache → calls processAllNodesForRule()
  → evaluates node with condition still False
  3. Test patches node condition to True → NO node reconciliation triggered!
  4. Test waits 30 seconds for taint removal → times out because node was never re-evaluated

  The logging enhancements were successful - they clearly show:
  - "Reconciling rule" + "Added rule to cache" when rules are created
  - "Processing all nodes for rule" with node counts
  - "Processing node against rules" with rule counts
  - Condition evaluation results
  - No node reconciliations after the condition update

  The issue is NOT with processAllNodesForRule() - that function works correctly. The issue is that
  node status updates aren't triggering the watch predicate.

⏺ The e2e tests have been completed with the enhanced logging, and the logs clearly show what's
  happening. The logging improvements were successful in diagnosing the issue.

  Key findings:
  1. ✅ Logging enhancements working perfectly - all new logs appear as expected
  2. ✅ Rule reconciliation IS happening - "Reconciling rule", "Added rule to cache" logs visible
  3. ✅ processAllNodesForRule() IS being called and processing nodes correctly
  4. ❌ Node status updates (condition changes) are NOT triggering node reconciliations

  The root cause is that the node controller's watch predicate isn't being triggered by node status
  updates, which is a separate issue from the original "rule not processing nodes" bug that we thought
  existed.
